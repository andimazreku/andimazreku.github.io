    "description": "I interviewed Alina Khashei and Sultan Ali Bostani to shape a memorial for people on the move related to their experiences and amplified through a faded estranged display on a tent. Dangers, obstacles, and occurrences on their paths through the Balkan route are individually exhibited as maps, while anonymized scenes of tight and minimal living conditions loop, from replicated motions to Sultan’s own recordings. The work serves as a tribute to Alina and Sultan.",

    "description": "In her seminal book Surveillance Capitalism, author Shoshana Zuboff describes how Big Tech is endangering basic democratic rights by turning humanity itself into a product. Self-consciousness and censorship increase as individuals strive to maintain a positive digital image. Manipulation extends further through targeted advertising and personalized content, distorting people’s perceptions of their true selves. The inherent power imbalance strips individuals of control over their self-image and identity, leaving them vulnerable and autonomy-deprived. Augmented reality overlays digital information onto the physical world. SCANOPTICON meshes the physical and virtual realm into one.",

In a fast-paced world, where information is mostly conveyed through images and simple visual structures, many have difficulties reading complex books. Therefore, we have selected chapters of the book to provide access in a new form, a magazine. In selecting the content, we have been very careful to preserve the views of the author.",
